# Tactica
Raid Boss Tactic Announcer for Turtle WoW â€” share strategies with your raid at the click of a button. Includes 85+ pre-written tactics by Doite covering all Turtle WoW raid content, plus the ability to add your own custom strategies.

## How to Use
The addon will automatically show the post UI/frame if you are the raid leader or have assist, when targeting a raid boss (move & lock/unlock available via "L"/"U" symbol to the top-right). It can be controlled more advanced through slash commands. The primary commands are `/tt` or `/tactica`, which will list available commands.
Other commands are:

### Post/announce raid tactics
`/tt post`
-   Select raid, boss and optionally tactic (else default if no custom has been added)
-   Will automatically show when selecting a raid boss, out of combat
-   You need to be raid leader or have assist (in a raid)

### Add custom raid tactics
`/tt add`
-   Select raid, boss and choose a name for the tactic
-   Press "enter" for line breaks that will divide the tactic into separate /raid messages in the tactic description box

### Manually post/announce raid tactics (for e.g. Macros)
`/tt <Raid Name>,<Boss Name>,[Tactic Name(optional)]`
-   Separated by a comma
-   The command is not case- or space-sensitive
-   Allows for abbreviations (e.g., "MC" instead of "Molten Core")
-   If no tactic is selected, it will pick the latest added (else the default tactic)

### Remove custom raid tactics
`/tt remove`
-   Only custom tactics will be removable
-   Dropdown populates based on saved custom tactics
-   Can not remove default tactics
